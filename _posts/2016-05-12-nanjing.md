_After the relentless noise that usually accompanies unfolding disaster, the most surprising thing about the end of the world was the enveloping quiet. First flooding, then drought, then locusts, famine and plague had ravaged the countryside. In once life-giving fields, rotten stalks obstinately clung in deathly brown stubble to the arid earth. Desperate hands or the mouths of pitiless insects had left no trace of edible plant or even tree bark. Husks of locusts were scattered on the ground, some chewed by humans, grimly evidencing the forlorn search for life. Perhaps mercifully, plague came and speeded death and the end of hunger. Homesteads and whole villages stood empty. In one penurious household, of the Zhu family, it took only a few weeks in April for most of the family to die. First father, various children and finally mother. The only survivors were two teenage boys. A kindly surviving neighbour, perhaps mindful of the possibilities of his own fate, donated a scratch of earth to the boys for the necessary burials. By the edge of a field they dug a simple grave mound to cover the corpses. After finishing the grim task, the boys knelt to say goodbye to their family, praying for forgiveness for their inability to even provide a traditional burial. In death the spirits of their family remained humiliated by their poverty. The funereal music was the whimpering of their crying, it scratched at the silence, aggravating the boys' sense of their misery and isolation, fear, but then, slowly, rage. As he prayed, the younger of the two boys made a solemn promise from the depth of his soul: that he would keep faith with the dead. Looking up at the sky, through his tears, for a moment he knew that the spirit of the dead and his anger would burn into his own soul and then set the world alight. In China someone famous once said:_

_"A worthy man who does not take revenge is not
worthy. Where he cannot take his revenge right away he will remember it every
day before falling into sleep." _
