**Abstract:**

Atthe end of fourteenth century a young revolutionary leader named Zhu Yuanzhang successfully led a new Chinese empire through the chaos of the greatest civil wars of the Middle Ages to defeat Mongol tyranny in China.

Zhu was a self-taught ruthless military genius and social visionary. After overcoming huge odds and achieving brilliant success over his enemies, Zhu imposed his autocratic personality over his empire. The fates of millions would rest upon his imperial will and tens of thousands would be murdered to protect his regime. The imperial system he created would fundamentally survive over the coming centuries into the twentieth. Closely studied by Mao and other leaders as the last Han Chinese unifier of China before modern times, China has never truly left the shadow of Zhu's influence.

This book tells Zhu's great story, never before fully told in English, from the original Chinese sources. It is the story of Zhu's journey from poverty and despair to supreme power. An epic account of extreme bravery, religious fervour, the supernatural and true love but also unforgivable terror and cruelty - it is a story unlike any other, of many true heroes and villains, spanning some of the most spectacular conflicts of the middle ages in a destiny defining struggle to forge a new world.
